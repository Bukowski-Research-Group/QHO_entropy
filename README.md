# QHO_entropy
Calculate quasi-harmonic oscillator entropies from molecular trajectories

This code is under development and is supplied "as-is" with no implied warranty or assurances. 

QHO_entropy is a simplified method to compute quasi-harmonic entropies from molecular trajectories. This code is currently under development and testing. It is important to carefully test quality of the FFT and resulting VDOS on the calculated entropies. 

Included is a test case with gas phase water to predict vibrational frequencies in water. 

Two versions of the code are available, one is an interactive Jupyter Notebook for testing, the other is a standalone python script with argparse parameters

# Installation
The only dependencies are Atomic Simulation Environment (https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) and standard Numpy functions. With the dependencies set you should be able to run the script or notebook.
